# Remix-Simple-Starwars-App

Hello, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to participate in your selection process. Before being able to run the app, there are certain aspects that need to be addressed.

## .Env

You will need to config/create the .env since it is a bad practice to put it public with certain information (I know, this is code-test but you know). The only thing you have to use is this variables here.

```
# baseUrl
BASE_URL=https://swapi.dev/api/
```

## Run

I love Yarn, so you will have to use Yarn to run this app, don't worry isn't difficult.

```
yarn install

yarn buind <- If needed

yarn start
```

## Congrats!
